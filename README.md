## PBCMS

PBCMS is a basic content management system built on PHP. 

I've started this project since I've noticed that lately I have been building a lot of smaller projects with PHP instead of going all the way with a language like Node. I have been strongly against the use of PHP but there are certain usecases where it honestly provides the better solution.

**Why don't you just use wordpress?**

This project tries to focus itself towards developers but perhaps it will have the potential to spread to end consumers aswell. I don't like certain aspects of wordpress and find myself to install so many plugins that it radically slows it down and bloats the whole interface. I don't want.

I like to build my own and custom solutions to problems I encounter. PBCMS is just the foundation of a bigger project that I'm planning ahead of me.

## Warning for developers

This project is still in alpha and under heavy development. Expect API changes to be made before the initial v1.0.0 release will be made.

## Documentation

As of writing, this project lacks documentation and with over 15334 lines of code at this point I certainly realise I should have made more comments. This is one of the key points that I'm planning to tackle soon, at this point I luckily have most of the aspects of this project laid out in my head. 

I'm planning to start commenting everything and built documentation for the internal APIs with a project like PHPdoc soon enough. It will most likely be released under a docs folder in the repository and I will actively deploy it to my webserver.
